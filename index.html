                <h3>Hello, I'm Kimberly Lowell</h3>
                <p>I’m a freelance graphic design artist by trade, homeschool mama of three young boys, run a niche bakehouse out of our home, and am caretaker of a disabled veteran who has become family to us.</p>

                <p>Thanks for stopping by! Since moving our family to Arizona two years ago, life has been nonstop! We moved from the Midwest to explore our dream of homesteading and becoming self-sufficient.</p>
                <p>I have worked as a freelance graphic artist for over 20 years and can say that my lifetime passion has become my career, which I am so incredibly grateful for. I have also had the ability to bring my artwork to life within the niche bakehouse I recently started. This is SUPER exciting for me! I am a lifelong learner and a student at heart, however my faith, family and passions will always come first.</p>
                <p>Life is short, make the most of it!</p>
